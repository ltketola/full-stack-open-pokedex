This example deals with a fictional project of a small team. Python is chosen for the language of the project. The tools mentioned in this example are mostly unfamiliar to the writer. Therefore it is possible that some of the tools are really not suitable this imaginary project. The production team uses Visual Studio Code with Microsoft Python extension as an editor. The default Python linter for Visual Studio Code, pylint, is chosen for linting the project. Testing is taken care of by using pytest framework. In addition to unit tests, it enables end-to-end testing when a plugin called SeleniumBase installed. When the test results indicates the readiness for putting the current version into the production it is committed to the prjoect's GitHub repository. Then it is time for CircleCi to step in. The team uses it to confirm that production builds also run in the production environment without unexpected surprises and, after that, to deploy the product easily.

Why the team uses CircleCi in this project? The project is considered reasonably small and only one small team is working on it. Therefore there is no extra resource to maintain self-hosted CI setup. Additionally, this is probably a cheaper solution the project of small size. On the other hand, should the rquirements of the project change in the future, CircleCi offers also a self-hosted option.

Other alternatives to Jenkings and GitHub Actions, that are found after quick browsing, include GitLab, Travis CI, BuildMaster and Drone.io.
